📈 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM (Streamlit App)

🔍 Overview

This project predicts the next-day closing price of a selected stock using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model.
It is built with Streamlit, TensorFlow, and yfinance, providing an interactive and educational demonstration of time-series forecasting using deep learning.

Developed as part of a college mini-project to showcase the application of machine learning in financial forecasting.

🧠 Key Features

📊 Real-time Stock Data — fetched automatically using the yfinance API.

🔮 Next-Day Price Prediction — predicts the upcoming day’s closing price.

🧾 Pre-trained LSTM Model — trained on historical closing price data.

⚙️ Interactive Web Interface — built using Streamlit.

📉 Trend Insights — visually represents model predictions vs. actual data.

📈 Automatic Scaling — MinMaxScaler applied for consistent normalization.

🧠 Model Details

Model Type: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

Training Data: Historical stock closing prices

Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Optimizer: Adam

Prediction Output: Next-day closing price

🧩 Future Improvements

🧮 Add technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI, MACD).

🌐 Include real-time live updates.

📅 Extend to multi-day forecasting.

🧠 Use ensemble deep learning models (GRU + LSTM).

💬 Add news sentiment analysis to improve accuracy.
